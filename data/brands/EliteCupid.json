  "raw_text": "﻿EliteCupid\r\nCore Idea – For successful men and women who know what they want.\r\nWe emphasize that EliteCupid is not for casual dating, but for people who are clear about their intentions and are seeking meaningful, long-term relationships. The platform is designed for successful individuals who value not just attractiveness, but also life achievements.\r\nIt’s a perfect fit for men who have already reached a certain level of success, and for women looking to build a relationship with a confident, accomplished partner.\r\nEliteCupid is for people who know what they want in life and in love.\r\nIt’s where the successful and self-assured meet.\r\nKey positioning distinctions:\r\n* Focus on ambitious and successful individuals, without strict income segmentation\r\n\r\n* Create a feeling of both exclusivity and accessibility:\r\n\r\n   * Men feel they already deserve the very best\r\n\r\n   * Women feel confident they can meet successful, goal-oriented partners\r\n\r\n      * More accessible than ultra-elite platforms like MillionaireMatch, which may seem too closed off\r\n\r\n      * Easier to use than platforms like EliteSingles, which often face user complaints about outdated design and limited functionality\r\n\r\nTarget audience:\r\n         * Tier 1 countries\r\n\r\n         * Aged 40+\r\n\r\n         * Men and women\r\n\r\n         * With average to above-average income"
